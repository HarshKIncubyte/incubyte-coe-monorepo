# Incubyte COE — Rails API Project
> Part of my **Incubyte COE Learning Journey**

## Overview
This repository contains a **Ruby on Rails API-only application** built
progressively across multiple days of the Incubyte COE program.

Starting with GraphQL on Day 2, the project evolved through testing,
Docker, Elasticsearch and Redis caching.
